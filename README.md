# Yet another vi clone

I use vim/nvim every day, so I wanted to see how difficult would
it be to recreate the functionality myself using C.

Recently, while learning ncurses, I learnt the first version of
vi was made using the curses library. This is how the library was
chosen to be the backbone of the project.

# Installation

To build the project, run the command:

`$ make`

To run the executable:

`$ ./vi`

# Contributing

I would appreciate any interest in the project!

request.
